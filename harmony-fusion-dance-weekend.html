        <h1>Harmony Fusion Dance Weekend</h1>

        <h3>3 days of dance, nature and connection.</h3>

        <p>
          This cozy weekend event will take place on 2-5 August 2024 in Poręba
          Wielka, Poland. The location is approx. 60 km from Cracow (1h
          journey), with its well-connected airport Balice and is accessible by
          public transport. If you are coming from far away, this event is
          perfect to combine with visiting the famous historical city of Cracow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Join us to enjoy three days of dancing, connections and relaxing in
          the beautiful Polish mountains. This is an all-inclusive weekend in a
          comfortable hostel offering small rooms with private bathrooms. You
          will be able to fully enjoy all of the activities and not worry about
          preparing meals or doing the dishes. The hostel is located 200m from
          the entrance to the
          <a

          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The small size of the group and a programme leaving space for
          semi-formal skills exchanges, relaxed time and nature exploration will
          guarantee a familiar ambience.

        <h2 id="what-is-fusion">What is fusion?</h2>

        <p>
          Fusion is a dance style focused on connection and interpreting the
          music together. We dance to a huge variety of music: sometimes music
          associated with a particular dance style, sometimes electronic music,
          sometimes hip-hop, and sometimes something entirely
          different—depending on the DJ.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are dancers coming with very different backgrounds: from blues,
          kizomba, zouk, tango, or contact improvisation. Each dance is
          different, and you can always expect to see something new.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s a great dance for beginners as well: you don’t need experience in
          dancing. You can attend without anxiety and connect to the music as
          well as your partner—and dance as you feel. Besides that, we will have
          open level classes to help you start.
        </p>

        <p>
          Respect each other and be aware that everyone has a different
          perception of limits: better err on the side of being too polite and
          too respectful. Please talk to each other: ask for permission and tell
          people if they do something you are not OK with.
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone is repeatedly disrespecting your limits, please talk to the
          <b>care team</b> or the organizers.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't assume what role you’ll take in the dance; whether you lead,
            follow, or switch is up to you and your partner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check in with your partner about what kind of dance they would like,
            including whether they feel comfortable with close embraces or being
            dipped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Welcome everyone, embracing queerness and all types of bodies.t
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don’t want to dance with someone—just decline. You don’t have
            to provide justification nor promise a dance later.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are welcome to ask anyone to dance. Be comfortable hearing no
            from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone repeatedly declines to dance with you—take a hint, and
            stop asking them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In case anything uncomfortable happens to you, or you witness anything
          that concerns you, please get in contact with your care team or the
          organizers.

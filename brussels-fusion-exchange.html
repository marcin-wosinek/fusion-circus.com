      <h2 class="header">Workshops</h2>

      <div class="workshop">
        <h4>
          Dynamic consent: negotiating your comfort zone with your partner by
          Cédric and Nina
        </h4>
        <img
          class="image-small float-right"
          src="./assets/brussels/nina-cedric.jpg"
        />
        <p>
          In this workshop we will practice how to escalate the dance connection
          with the confidence that you stay in your partner's comfort zone, as
          well as how to de-escalate when things go to far for you. How to
          express and to read intentions to adjust the dance connection? We'll
          look at what happens when things go well, as well as what to do when
          your partner isn't receptive to your non-verbal communication.
        </p>

        <h4>BodySync: Embrace Yourself, Embrace Each Other by Agnieszka</h4>
        <img class="image-small float-left" src="./assets/team/agnieszka.png" />
        <p>
          We will delve deep into the connections within our bodies and the
          dynamics of partnering in dance. Through a series of immersive
          exercises and explorations, we will experiment with various movement
          qualities, communication with a dance partner and develop sensitivity
          and responsiveness.
        </p>

        <h4>Exploring the Counter Balance by Atenea</h4>
        <img
          class="image-small float-right"
          src="./assets/brussels/atenea-workskhop.jpg"
        />
        <p>
          We will enter into the world of counter balance to understand one of
          the most precious resources that connection as a couple offers us. The
          creation of common movement between the two parts from the
          compensation of weights. We will explain the concept itself and
          explore its possibilities.
        </p>

        <h4>Musicality: choosing your energy by Diana</h4>
        <img
          class="image-small float-left"
          src="./assets/brussels/diana-workshop.jpg"
        />
        <p>
          In Diana's dance class on musicality, we will delve into the art of
          expressing music through movement. Musicality involves dancing to the
          beat, yes, but also understanding the subtleties of the different
          instruments or the emotional nuances of the music. This lesson will
          help dancers listen, identify various elements of the music, and
          explore how to embody these elements in their dance through play and
          emotional exploration. Some content : identifying rhythms, musical
          phrases, clapping exercises, marking a time with a pose, embodying
          emotions and energies, applied to couple's dancing.
        </p>

        <h4>Cocreating a dynamic and flowing dance by Sandrine</h4>

          Creating a dynamic, cocreative flowing dance from compression and

          Sundrine, Zouk & Fusion teacher, organizer, DJ, from France, Toulouse
          <br />
          I have a background in couple dances, contemporary, contact
          improvisation and I have been teaching couple dances since 1995 in
          Toulouse, France. In 2015 I discovered the Brazilian Zouk and it
          changed my life!
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the dance, the community, the kindness of the people, music
          diversity…. I was totally seduced by Soulzouk as it embraces my dance
          values: connection, social dance, creativity, respecting individuality
          of each dancer. I feel blessed to have met China and to be part of the
          Soulzouk family. I am also MAC certified.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met Fusion in 2014 and I have been actively participating to spreed
          it in Europe, starting in Toulouse, France in 2018. I am
          co-creator/organizer of the Toulouse Fusion Week-End. I am DJing in
          the Zouk and Fusion monthly events I organize, and in Fusion
          international events: I especially enjoy chasing new music for Fusion.

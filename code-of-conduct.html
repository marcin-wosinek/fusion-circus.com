      <p>
        Respect each other and be aware that everyone has a different perception
        of limits: better err on the side of being too polite and too
        respectful. Please talk to each other: ask for permission and tell
        people if they do something you are not OK with.
      </p>

      <p>
        If someone is repeatedly disrespecting your limits, please talk to the
        <b>care team</b> or the organizers.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Don't assume what role you’ll take in the dance; whether you lead,
          follow, or switch is up to you and your partner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check in with your partner about what kind of dance they would like,
          including whether they feel comfortable with close embraces or being
          dipped.
        </li>
        <li>Welcome everyone, embracing queerness and all types of bodies.t</li>
        <li>
          If you don’t want to dance with someone—just decline. You don’t have
          to provide justification nor promise a dance later.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are welcome to ask anyone to dance. Be comfortable hearing no from
          time to time.
        </li>
        <li>
          If someone repeatedly declines to dance with you—take a hint, and stop
          asking them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In case anything uncomfortable happens to you, or you witness anything
        that concerns you, please get in contact with your care team or the
        organizers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note!</b> If you have ever been banned from any dance community or
        event, please contact the organizer before purchasing your ticket. We
        want to make sure everybody feels safe—and we would need to double-check
        if we can have you at the event. Failure to notify us can result in your
        being banned from the event.
